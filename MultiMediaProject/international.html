                    <h3>World Bank: Oman’s Economic Outlook Positive for 2024</h3>
                    <p>
                        The World Bank forecasts Oman’s economy to grow by 1.5% in 2024, driven by increased gas production and economic diversification efforts. Key initiatives include enhancing the business environment, supporting SMEs, and advancing renewable energy investments, such as green hydrogen. Inflation is expected to stabilize at 2% over the medium term.
                        In the GCC region, growth is projected at 2.8% in 2024 and 4.7% in 2025, supported by a recovery in oil production and robust non-oil sector expansion. Despite diversification efforts, hydrocarbons will remain vital to fiscal stability, with the GCC fiscal surplus narrowing to 0.1% of GDP in 2024.
                        The report emphasizes improving education quality as essential for long-term growth, urging investments in foundational skills, teaching practices, and data-driven education policies to enhance human capital competitiveness globally.
