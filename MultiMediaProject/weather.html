                    <h3>Severe Weather Alerts</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Oman Meteorological Department of the Civil Aviation Authority has issued weather forecasts for the Sultanate of Oman within the country, indicating that there is a high probability of thunderstorms in many areas within the country, and cumulus clouds are expected to form and that rain will be accompanied by winds in many areas.
                        Apple has introduced several important features in the weather app, as the weather app can send a notification in the event of a severe weather alert near you, so you can get alerts for major rainstorms, floods, hurricanes, heat waves and tornadoes, according to MacRumors. You can turn on severe weather alerts for your current location and any location you have added to the weather app, and severe weather data is available for most countries in the world.

                    <h3>Climate Change Impact</h3>
                    <p>
                        Climate change is a global or regional alteration caused by human activities, primarily greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in the "greenhouse effect" and affecting the environment, society, and economy. Oman has experienced significant financial losses from tropical storms, with Cyclone Gonu causing $4 billion in 2007 and Mekunu causing $1.5 billion in 2018. Al-Batinah North, Muscat, Sur, and Salalah are particularly vulnerable due to Oman's coastline and coastal areas.
