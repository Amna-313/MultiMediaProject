                    <p>Marco Verratti may leave Inter due to his fluctuating performance in Qatar with Al-Arabi, with the club interested in the midfielder. Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca confirmed that his player Christopher Nkunku will not leave next January, and may move to Manchester United.

Inter is considering a move for Jonathan David, with rumours intensifying after seeing his agent at the San Siro during Inter's match against Leipzig. Juventus are marketing Douglas Luiz and Nicolo Fagiolo in the January transfer market, as they are out of coach Thiago Motta's plans.
